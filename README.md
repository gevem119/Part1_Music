The skeleton of code is given to predefine the link to the buzzer, buttons and preset notes
There are 2 predefined tunes
your task is to define the function in order to iterate through the list of notes to play a song
these will play when you press one of the buttons on the maker pico

if you want another challenge, or a hint, i added a second task which has the model answer for the songs and it's for you to add an LED flash for each note
