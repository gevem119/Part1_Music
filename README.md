# Part 1: Music
Difficulty: Easy

The skeleton of code is given to predefine the link to the buzzer, buttons and preset notes
There are 2 predefined tunes
Your task is to define the function in order to iterate through the list of notes to play the song when a button is pressed

If you want another challenge, or a hint, I added a second task which has the model answer for the songs and it's for you to add an LED flash for each note

# Requirements (nothing additional needed)
For this project I used:
- MakerPico
- Pico W 
- Thonny/ micropython
